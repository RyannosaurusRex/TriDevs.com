# TriDev's Future Site
The goal of the [TriDev meetup](https://meetup.com/tridev) has always been to bring 
developers together in our region. The meetup has always been an important 
part of that, but recently we've expanded to Slack, and tried 
to bring together more meetups and more people who can't make it 
out to the meetup together. This site aims to be a starting point 
for developers, designers, and tech entrepreneurs to network, grow their 
careers and businesses, improve both technical and soft skills, and promote the Tri-Cities
Tennessee region.
